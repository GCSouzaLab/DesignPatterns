### Above you'll find some details of design patterns


## Factory

Factory is a pattern that allows to create objects dynamically. 
It allows you to create objects through an interface or abstract class, hiding the details of concrete implementations.

It follows a few principles, that can be summarized as:
- Factory is open to extension, but closed to modification
- Factory is used to create objects that are related to each other

## Singleton

The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.
It helps us with managing resources, such as databases, network connections, or other shared objects. 

** But remember, that it's not a good idea to use a Singleton for a global variable.
